# Simple-Password-Creator
Simple password creator in Lua 🔐
The script takes in input these 4 user preferences:

- 📏 Length of the password (number of characters),
- 🔣 If the user wants symbols (like # * _ ) & etc.),
- 🔢 If the user wants numbers,
- 🔠 If the user wants uppercase letters,

then creates a charset based on these preferences and then creates the password using random characters from the charset
